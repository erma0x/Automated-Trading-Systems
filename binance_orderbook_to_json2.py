Import the necessary libraries for interacting with the Binance API and working with JSON data, such as requests and json.

Define a function for making a request to the Binance API for orderbook data for a specific trading pair. This function should take the trading pair as an input and return the orderbook data in the form of a dictionary.

Define a function for storing the orderbook data in a JSON database. This function should take the orderbook data and the name of the JSON file as inputs and write the data to the file in a format that can be easily accessed later.

Define a main function that loops through a list of trading pairs and calls the API request and JSON storage functions for each pair. This function should also include a try/except block to handle any errors that may arise during the API request or JSON storage process.

In the main function, add a delay between API requests to avoid exceeding Binance's rate limits.

Test the program with a sample list of trading pairs and verify that the orderbook data is being correctly stored in the JSON file.
